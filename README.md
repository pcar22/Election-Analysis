## Challenge Overview
A script was written using Python, this script is written to pull information from the election_results.csv file provided. In this script we can extract the information needed to do get the candidate, county and number of votes. Calculations are done to total votes and percentages. 
## Challenge Summary
The PyPoll.py script is a great tool to use to reveal critical data. This is a great tool to use on other election data. With some modifications this script can extract other information to produce different reports.
